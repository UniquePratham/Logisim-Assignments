1. Implement a multibus computational system as shown in the attached file.
2. Store the following Program in memory
           LD A //AC <--Mem[A]
           ADD B //AC<--AC + Memo[B]
           ST C // Mem[C] <-- AC
3. Store two 16-bit numbers in Memory Location A and B
4. Implement a hardwired control unit for this multibus system.

5. Now execute the program using your computational system after initializing PC with the starting address of the program.

Note:
For LD A, first read A into DR and then perform transfer operation in ALU
For ADD B, first read B into DR and then perform ADD operation in ALU
