1. Implement the basic Shift and Add Multiplier with 8 bit Adder and 8 bit Registers to multiply two 4-bit numbers.
2. Implement the improved Shift and Add Multiplier with 4-bit Adder and 4 bit Registers to multiply two 4-bit numbers.
3. Implement the Booth's Multiplier with 4-bit Adder and 4 bit Registers to multiply two 4-bit numbers.


Note: 
1. Use Logisim to implement the multipliers. 
2. For left shifting the register, you may use it in reverse direction with a Splitter.
3. Use Clock to implement the loop manually.
